# fcc-relational-databases
This is from the freeCodeCamp Relational Database certificate, where I created multiple database projects using SQL, PostgreSQL, Bash, Shell Scripting, and Nano. 
The projects I have built inlcuded a World database, Celestial Bodies database, and a Bike rental shop. 

This certificate honed my skills in creating and querying relational databases and created interactive applications with scripting.
